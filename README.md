# Multi-Omics Database

## Project Overview
This database provides a comprehensive collection of multi-omics datasets from our integrative study, including transcriptomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and microbial community profiling (bacteria, fungi, viruses). It aims to facilitate exploration of cross-omics interactions and reproducible research.

## Network Visualization
Users can explore the interactive correlation network, highlighting associations between microbial taxa, independent factors, and host transcriptomic profiles. Nodes represent microbial species or host factors, while edges indicate statistically significant correlations.

## Data Access
All datasets are available for download:
- [Download Raw Data](data/raw/)
- [Download Processed Matrices](data/matrices/)
